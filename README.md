# Darkmoor

In the *First Fantasy Campaign*, Dave Arneson describes a migration algorithm that was to be calculated by hand using dice. Such a strategy is a bit unwieldly to perform as instructed over a large grid, but I believe a computer could execute it much more easily.

The rules can be thought of as being like Conway's Game of Life, with more random elements, and battles fought for control over individual spaces.

I'm curious to see what the results are.
